# Project: Building the Home Town App

## Part 1:

The code base given wasn't responsive. In order to make it responsive I:

* Added a <meta> viewport to the page with initial scale set.
* Adjusted CSS and markup so that everything displays in a single column.
* Used relative widths so that things stretch to fit across any viewport width.
* Added padding to the touch targets so they are easy to hit.
* Tested the sit across different viewports using Firefox and Chrome Dev Tools.
